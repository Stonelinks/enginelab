<strong>What is this?</strong>
<p class="message">
    This is live control over a stirling engine in my apartment. I built the engine and hooked it up to the internet
    mostly for fun, but also because it seemed like a great idea to give anonymous strangers on the internet control
    over an open flame
    10 feet away
    from where I sleep. Seriously though, I turn this off if I'm away since I don't want it burning
    the place down when I'm gone.

<strong>How does it work?</strong>
<p class="message">
    Stirling engines are pretty simple. They're powered by temperature differences. This engine has a small alcohol
    burner to provide heat. The burner is attached to a servo so it can move around underneath the engine. When
    the burner's flame is underneath the cylinder, the temperature difference increases so the engine speeds up.
    Similarly when the burner is moved away, it cools and slows down.

    The commanded RPM (set with the slider below) is fed into a simple PID controller that uses RPM as feedback. This
    controller then moves the servo (and thus the flame) around to change or maintain engine speed. You can check
    out graphs of all this stuff below as the engine runs.

<strong>What code runs it?</strong>

    This entire thing is powered by maybe a couple hundred lines of unfancy javascript. All hardware IO is done with
    firmata because I don't feel like writing firmware. If you're an interested turbo nerd, the git repo for it is <a
